# **What is cryptography?**

Imagine two people **Ajay and Nandhinii** who share an important secret have to split.This requires them to communicate private information from a distance.
However ,eavesdropper **Nandhinii's sister** wants information and has the ability to interecept their messages.
So , Ajay decides to communicate using letter written in some kind of secret code.

First, Ajay looks his message in a box , using a **lock** that only he and Nandhinii know the combination to.This is called **encryption**.
Then, the locked message is sent to Nandhinii.when Nandhinii receives the box , she opens it using the **code** they shared in advance. This is called **decryption**.

## **Cryptography begins when we abandon physical locks and use 'ciphers' instead.**

Assume ciphers as a virtual locks. Ciphers allows Ajay and Nandhinii to **scramble and descramble** thier message so that they would appear meaningless , If
Nandhinii's Sister intercepted them.
> Cryptography is at the heart of the worldwide communication network today.The Interesting story of cryptography requires us to understand two very old ideas related to **number thery and probability**.
